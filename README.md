### Exposure to shifts in US long-term (10Y) yields
This repository currently contains the source code used to download data and conduct a high-level analysis of the impact that spreads between domestic and US bond yields may have on local economic activity and prices.

- Module `utils.py` loads data and defines several functions that can be used to manipulate dataframes referring to trade data, exchange rates, and GDP.
- `main.ipynb` contains the body of the analysis, including regression models and graphs.
